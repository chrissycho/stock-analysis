# Module 2: An Analysis of Stocks
Performing analysis on Steve's parents' stock data

### Challenge
*I have analyzed 2017 and 2018 stock data that Steve's parents are interested in investing. I wanted to know how often a stock was traded and its year return. By using the for loop codes, I was able to collect the sum of each stock's daily volume and the perecentage of yearly return. I had nested for loop for tickers so I can indetify a tickerIndex. Then I had looped that particular ticker for all the rows and calculated volume, starting price and ending price. The reason I nested the tickers first is so that I don't have to loop the entire data(3013 rowS) 12 times for each volume, starting, and ending price. This will be helpful if we have more variables and more data tby saving the time and removing unncessary steps. The volumes which indicates total volumes of a particular ticker was also set as 0 by defining the array as long.
