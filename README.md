# Module 2: An Analysis of Stocks
Performing analysis on Steve's parents' stock data

### Challenge
"I have analyzed the 2017 and 2018 stock data that Steve's parents are interested in investing in. I wanted to know how often a stock was traded and its year return. Using the for loop codes, I was able to collect the sum of each stock's daily volume and the percentage of yearly profit. I had nested for loop for tickers so I can identify a tickerIndex. Then I had looped that particular ticker for all the rows and calculated volume, starting price, and ending price. I nested the tickers first because I don't have to loop the entire data(3013 rows) 12 times for each volume, starting and ending prices. This will be helpful if we have more variables and more data by saving time and removing unnecessary steps. The "volumes" which indicate total volumes of a particular ticker were also set as 0 by defining the array as long. Based on the analysis of 2017 and 2018, only "ENPH" and "RUN" remained to have positive yearly returns for both 2017 and 2018. I would suggest Steve recommending "ENPH" and "RUN" to his parents for the investment.*
